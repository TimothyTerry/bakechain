Bakechain is a multi-platform, secure light "baker" for the Tezos protocol. Users can participate in the baking process without having to install and maintain a full Tezos-node. Bakechain relies on access to public tezos-nodes via the RPC API, however a user can choose to point the software at their own node if they wish.

Follow @BakeChainon Twitter to keep up to date with the latest announcements.

Please note - BakeChain is currently in alpha. We strongly recommend that you do not use your contribution details, or any private keys that you wish to use when the mainnet launches. Please ensure you're using fresh keys with the intention to discard them when Tezos launches.
